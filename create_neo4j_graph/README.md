# Intro
This repository contains some sample scripts to create nodes and relationship in Neo4j. 
The script is based on the Academic graph from OpenAlex.
Also, these are sample scripts, so you will need to update your code depending upon your dataset.
I will try to provide a simple dataset and executable notebook in the future, if I get chance!

## Requirement
You will need Neo4j AuraDB instance here: [Neo4j AuraDB](https://neo4j.com/cloud/platform/aura-graph-database/?ref=nav-get-started-cta)
Data set for Academic Grpah can be downloaded from OpenAlex api here: [OpenAlex](https://docs.openalex.org/)
